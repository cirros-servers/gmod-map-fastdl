# gmod-addon-scripts

Just a few scripts to help manage addons for my Garry's Mod server.  
Should only be used for resources that **need** to end up on the client.  
Everything else can be handled just fine by `resource.AddWorkshop()`.

## Dependencies

-   A Steam account that owns Garry's Mod (duh)
-   Your Linux distribution's flavor of `bzip2`, available in `PATH`
-   [steamcmd](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/SteamCMD)
