# gmod-addon-scripts

Just a few scripts to help manage addons for my Garry's Mod server.  
Should only be used for resources that **need** to end up on the client.  
Everything else can be handled just fine by `resource.AddWorkshop()`.

## Dependencies

-   A Steam account that owns Garry's Mod (duh)
-   [gmod-lzma](https://github.com/WilliamVenner/gmod-lzma-rs)
-   [gmad](https://github.com/Facepunch/gmad)
-   [steamcmd](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/SteamCMD)
